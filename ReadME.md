Requirement Analysis for Building a Neural Network

To implement a basic neural network, the following components are required:

1. **Data Handling** - check
   - Data loading (from CSV, JSON, etc.)
   - Data preprocessing (normalization, splitting into train/test sets)

2. **Network Architecture** - check
   - Definition of layers (input, hidden, output)
   - Layer configuration (number of neurons, connections)

3. **Activation Functions** - check
   - Implementation of activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
   - Support for selecting activation per layer

4. **Forward Propagation** - check
   - Mechanism to compute outputs from inputs through layers

5. **Loss Function** - check
   - Implementation of loss functions (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy)

6. **Backward Propagation** - check
   - Calculation of gradients for weights and biases

7. **Optimizer**
   - Implementation of optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam)
   - Learning rate management

8. **Training Loop**
   - Iterative process to update weights using optimizer
   - Support for epochs and batch processing

9. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
   - Prediction on new/unseen data

10. **Utilities**
    - Saving/loading model parameters
    - Logging and visualization (optional)

Optional Extensions:
- Support for different layer types (convolutional, recurrent)
- Regularization techniques (dropout, L2/L1)
- Hyperparameter tuning

This analysis covers the essential components needed for a functional neural network implementation.
